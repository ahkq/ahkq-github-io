# calc
Hello! This is my little calculator project. It didn't take too long to build as it only does addition and subtraction, along with the equal and clear functions so it is fairly simple but quite functional. I created it to be represented as an example of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I am familiar with although I work best with Python.
